How to write class

class Listnode (object):
    def __init__(self, data, pointer):
        self.data = data
        self.pointer = pointer

obstructed data type:

TYPE 
	TDirections = (North,East,South,West)
	TDays = (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday)

	DECLARE Direction: Direction
	DECLARE StartDay: TDays


TYPE
	TMypointer = ^<Type name>
	DECLARE MyPointer : TMyPointer


TYPE
TEmployeeRecord
	DECLARE EmplyeeFirstName : STRING
	DECLAREE EmployeeFamilyName: STRING

Front end analysis
lexical analysis---seperate code into tokens

symbol table records the name/attributes of the identifier

syntax analysis-- analysis the consturction
Parse tree

semantic analysis---establish the full meaning of the code
annotated abstract syntax tree

Complex set instruction/ simplified set instruction computer

RISC:

fewer instructions
simpler instructions
small number of instruction formats
single-cycle instructions whenever possible
Fixed-length instructions
only load and store instructions into address memory
fewer addressing modes
multiple registers used
hard-wired computing unit
pipelining easier

CISC

microprogrammed computing unit
many types of instructions to address memory


pipelining:

cpu

Authentication: The receiver must be certain of the identity of the sender

Confidentiality: Only the intended recipient can decrypt the data

Integrity: The cipher text can not be modified by others

Non-repudiation: The receiver can not deny the involvement transmutation 

Availability: Nothing  can prevent the receiver from getting the data

Give three steps taken by both Computer A and the File server to allow them to transmit their packets successfully.

Both stop transmitting Each uses a random time Wait for time period Check for bus status Attempt to re-transmit



Adding a switch to the LAN changes its topology. Explain how the use of a switch removes the problem identified in part (c)(i)

Star topology created
A switch has a number of ports
Each connects to a single device (using a dedicated cable)
Switch provides direct transmission/path from device to device Collisions are no longer possible
There are dedicated links from Computer A to Computer C AND from the Server to Computer D




(a) Name three data items present in a digital certificate.

Serial number
Certificate Authority that issued certificate
CA digital signature
Name of company/organisation/individual/subject/owner owning Certificate
‘Subject’ public key
Period during which Certificate is valid 




State the name given to the encrypted message digest.

Digital signature



Explain the difference between a guest operating system and a host operating system.

Guest operating system:
An operating system running in a virtual machine // Controls virtual hardware //
OS is being emulated
Host operating system:
The operating system that is actually controlling the physical hardware // the operating system for the physical machine// the OS running the VM software
Guest OS is running under the Host OS softwareDescribe two possible uses of virtual machines by the company.

Trial/use alternative replacement operating system(s) ...
Test to identify possible problems
Much easier to create VM with a new OS than create new computer system
Trial/use alternative replacement web server software ...
Test to identify possible problems
Easier to try alternative new software and new OS combinations




The programmers prefer to debug their programs using an interpreter. Give one possible reason why.

debugging is faster / easier
// can debug incomplete code // better diagnostics

How to ensure downloaded softwares are authentic

• software is put through hashing algorithm
• hash total is encrypted with private key (digital signature)
• software + encrypted hash / digital signature are sent
• receiver is in possession of sender’s public key
• the received hash total / digital signature is decrypted with public key
(SH)
• the receiver hashes received software (RH)
• If SH matches RH then software is authentic and has not been altered




Advantage of a seriel file

• no need to re-sort data every time new data is added
• only a small file so searching will require little processing
• new records can easily be appended



Tracker: central server that:
stores details of other computers that have all / part of file to be downloaded
// has data on those peers downloading and uploading file
// shares IP addresses with other clients in swarm allowing them to connect1 1(ii)Seed: peer computer
that has 100% of file // is uploading downloaded content1 1(iii)
Swarm: all the connected peer computers
that have all or part of the file to be downloaded / uploaded // share a torrent1 1




(i) Server
(ii) Command 
(iii) Anonymous

Server: central computer
stores files that are to be downloaded
Command: user can send action/instruction (or by example, e.g. change directory)
that are carried out on server Anonymous: allows user to access files
user does not need to identify themselves to server

(ii) Explain how Anna can be sure that it is Bob who has sent the key.


Bob sends his digital certificate
Digital certificate contains Bob’s public key
Successful decryption of certificate using CA’s public key provides legitimacy 1 mark for any valid point – max 2
