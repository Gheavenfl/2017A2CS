# Christmas Project

I always wanted to purchase a watch

so I decided to make a watch using pygame

since pygame refresh at a constant rate, I can take advantage of that.

I can either get the initial time from the computer, or input them manually.

The watch should include a date function, and a display of am/pm.

The display of each hand of second/hour/minute should include two positions.

The of the central point of the watch, the other point should be calculated 

using a function that uses the time record kept inside the program.I think I

can somehow use recursion and linked list.



I also planned to add
